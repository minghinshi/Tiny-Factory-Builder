# Tiny Factory Builder [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/minghinshi/tiny-factory-builder/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/minghinshi/tiny-factory-builder)  
A tiny factory game. Games like modded Minecraft, Factorio, shapez.io and more looked incredibly fun to play, which inspired me to create my own.  

After 3 months of work, the game is playable with saving and loading implemented. There's lots of polishing and adding features to do still, but I'm proud of what I've managed to do so far.
