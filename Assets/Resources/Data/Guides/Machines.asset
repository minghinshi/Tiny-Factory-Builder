  - Excellent! You now have a new machine that's ready to produce more materials.
    You will also notice a few more crafting recipes have been unlocked.
  - Every time you obtain a key item, your factory advances into the next Stage and
    you'll gain knowledge of new processes.
  - The next key item is the Campfire, which will involve growing trees and harvesting
    Branches in order to create one. Let's take a look at how it can be done.
  - Click on the recipe book button, which is the singular book on the bottom left.
    Here, you can view all of the recipes you currently have access to.
  - Find the Campfire and click on it. Just like in the crafting page, you can see
    what materials and machines it needs, and what the outputs are.
  - You can view the recipes of the inputs and machines without going back to the
    main page! Try clicking on the Branch.
  - Crafting Branches will require a Sapling processed inside another machine, a
    Forest, and so on. Keep clicking to see what you'll need to craft in order to
    progress.
  - The whole chain starts with the Light Source, which converts anything that's
    glowing into Light.
  - The Light can then be crafted into Growth Essence, a resource suitable for photosynthesis.
    It will help obtain the Branches that you need.
  - Let's try making Light by placing Fire into the Light Source. Select Fire from
    your inventory.
  - When you click on something in your inventory that's not a building, you'll enter
    item placing mode. Here, click on the Light Source to insert 1 Fire into it.
  - The Light Source will start processing Fire into Light. You may also want to
    insert more than 1 Fire; hold Shift to insert 10, Ctrl to insert 100 and both
    to insert 1,000.
  - When you're done, press Q to exit item placement. Just like from Jars, you can
    retrieve finished products from the Light Source by clicking it.
  - If you inserted unwanted items by accident, you may hold Shift and click on the
    machine to retrieve both inputs and outputs.
  - Now that you know how to make things from buildings, craft your way to the Campfire!
    Your next focus should be to grow some Saplings in a Plantation.
  - Remember, if you don't know how to craft an item, consult the recipe book. This
    will be crucial for the rest of the game.
  - Finally, you can read these guides again by finding them in the Guides menu,
    which can be accessed by clicking on the button with multiple books.
  - You can also find other guides that are unlocked but not automatically displayed.
    1 of them has just been unlocked, so go check it out!
  - Hope you have a good time building up a tiny factory, and see you again when
    you craft your first Campfire!
