  - Finally, a source of heat! This will be crucial to many processes later.
  - Right now, you can concentrate large amounts of heat into Soil to melt it, and
    then cool it down to turn it into Stone. With this, you can create sturdy stone
    tools.
  - Your first stone tool will be an Axe, which allows you to harvest a Tree instead
    of a Sapling, giving a higher yield of Branches and some Logs.
  - Collect your first piece of Log to complete this Stage! It will come in handy
    very soon.
